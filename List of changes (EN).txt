VERSION 1.1

NEW:

- ITEM: 
	-- FairyFeather. Boosts Fairy-type moves by 20%
		* LOCATION: Sometimes Picknicker Tiffany calls you and hands it over.
	-- Sitrus Berry. Replaces Gold Berry, healing 25% MAX HP instead of 30HP.
	-- PP MAX. Maximizes PPs of a single move.
	-- "X SP. DEF" was also added. Boosts Special Defense by 2x.

CHANGES:
- Type matchups: GHOST- and DARK-type moves now deal neutral damage to Steel-type Pokémon instead of 1/2 damage.

- TMs can be used indefinitely, just like in Gen 5!

- The teams of Gym Leaders, Elite Four and Champion have been slightly adjusted to resemble their Gen 4 teams.

- Moves:
	* Leech Life now has 80 Power.
	* Crunch reduces Physical Defense instead of Sp. Def. (Gen 4 onwards).
	* Hidden Power now always has 70 Power, instead of changing depending on your DVs.
	* Growth acts like in Gen 5, also boosting your Physical Attack and doubling your boost if there's Harsh Sunlight.

	-- Defense: 	14, 15
	-- Speed: 	14, 15
	-- Special: 	14, 15
	* NOTE: Thanks to this, getting a Shiny Female Pokémon whose gender ratio is 7M:1F is now possible.
	* Because of the Shiny DV requirements' change, the Red Gyarados from Lake of Rage will always have perfect DVs.

		-- The Egg can be either Nidoran♀ or Nidoran♂.

- The GS Ball has been restored! Now you can activate it when you defeat the Elite Four for the 1st time (just like in the 3DS version).

	** NPC dialogues that varied depending on the time have been adjusted accordingly.

	-- Goldenrod Department Store (4F)
	-- Celadon Department Store (5F)
	-- Goldenrod Radio Tower (exchange for 5 Blue Points)

- The rematch system has been improved: Now trainer's teams will be upgraded as we progress through our adventure, instead of also taking into account how many times we've fought them.
